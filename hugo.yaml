    content: |-
      I am a game developer with a passion for real-time rendering studying Creative Media and Game Technologies in my third year at Breda University of Applied Sciences. Although focusing on graphics programming, I have interests and experience working with optimizations, engine architecture, gameplay programming and tools development.

      Voxel engines and everything regarding real-time global illumination are my favorite topics to study and work with. Currently I am working in my spare time on a custom GI solution that works using only cellular automata.
